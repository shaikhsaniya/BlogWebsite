          <h2>AI in 2020: From Experimentation to Adoption</h2>

            AI has captured the imagination and attention of people globally.
            But in the business world, the rate of adoption of artificial
            intelligence has lagged behind the level of interest through 2019.
            Even though we hear that most business leaders believe AI provides a
            competitive advantage, up until recently, some industry watchers
            have pegged enterprise adoption at less than 20%. But as we enter
            2020, we’re spotting an uptick, not only in interest but in AI
            adoption. And that uptick is reaffirmed by a recent global survey
            commissioned by IBM. The survey, From Roadblock to Scale: The Global
            Sprint Towards AI, polled more than 4,500 technology decision
            makers. We wanted to gauge the current and future states of AI
            deployment across the U.S., Europe and China, to better understand
            the landscape and the challenges. As you’ll see, it’s about to
            change dramatically.

            There’s a paradox in the world of AI: While it’s the largest
            economic opportunity of our lifetime (estimated to contribute $16
            trillion to GDP by 2030), enterprise adoption of AI was less than 4%
            in 2018. A recent Gartner survey said that the 4% in 2018 has now
            grown to 14% in 2019. But still, that is meager. This is for a
            variety of reasons: lack of skills, lack of tools, lack of
            confidence, etc. But the biggest issue is cultural. For
            organizations that want to participate in this phase of innovation
            and wealth creation in technology, the most important thing is a
            beginner’s mindset; a willingness to try, and an acceptance of
            failure. Organizations should seek to do 100 AI experiments a year,
            knowing that more than 50% will fail. Many company cultures are not
            suited for that. A more typical approach is to rally around one big
            AI project, committing a lot of people, time and money. I do not
            advise that approach. AI is about mass experimentation, not one big
            project implementation. This ain’t ERP.
